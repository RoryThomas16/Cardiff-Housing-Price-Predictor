<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is practice for me, this is for me to practice more my regressors but also doesn't hurt to keep trying and practicing the same core concepts. I also want to try my hand at some neural networks and this seems a friendly project to broach this on.

- The Web Scraping is basically sifting through historical house price data and putting this into a useable format.
- The Machine Learning is basically taking the house price data (along with # of Bedrooms, # of Bathrooms, Property Type (e.g., terraced, semi-detached), and Date) and predicts what the house price will be in 'N' years.
